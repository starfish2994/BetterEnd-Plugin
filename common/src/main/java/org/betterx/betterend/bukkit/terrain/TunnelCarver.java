/**
 * The mod's tunnel carver, ported to a per-chunk pass. The second of BetterEnd's two carvers; the
 * first is {@link CaveCarver}, and the six cave biomes list both.
 * <p>
 * Source: {@code Reference/BetterEnd/.../world/carvers/EndTunnelCarver.java} and its configured form
 * {@code worldgen/configured_carver/tunnel_cave.json} -- probability 1.0, threshold 0.15. The other
 * four config fields ({@code replaceable}, {@code y}, {@code yScale}, {@code lava_level}) are never
 * read: the carver hard-codes the end-stone tag instead of {@code cfg.replaceable} and touches
 * {@code cfg} only for the probability and the threshold.
 * <p>
 * <b>Why this is far cheaper than {@link CaveCarver}.</b> The mod's {@code getRange()} is 0 because
 * the noise field is spatially continuous: a chunk reads only its own columns and the tunnels line
 * up across borders by construction. There is no neighbourhood scan and no per-start-chunk RNG --
 * probability is 1.0, so every chunk in a cave biome carves itself.
 * <p>
 * <b>Seed.</b> The mod draws its noise seed from the carving context's {@code RandomState}, a
 * positional factory keyed on {@code betterend:tunnel_cave_noise}, which a Bukkit generator cannot
 * reach. A salt off the world seed stands in, exactly as {@code BiomePlacement}'s cave noises do.
 * Everything downstream is the mod's verbatim -- {@link Random} IS {@code LegacyRandomSource}, and
 * the three {@code nextInt()} draws happen in the order h, v, d. So the tunnels have the mod's
 * character and a DIFFERENT layout for a given world seed, which is already true of {@link
 * CaveCarver}: no world this port generates was ever bit-compatible with the mod's.
 * <p>
 * Deterministic in the world seed alone, and pure in {@code (worldSeed, placement, chunkX, chunkZ)}.
