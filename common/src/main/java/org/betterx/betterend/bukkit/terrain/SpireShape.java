/**
 * BLOSSOMING SPIRES' two {@code raw_generation} features, as a pure function of
 * {@code (worldSeed, chunkX, chunkZ)}.
 * <p>
 * Source: {@code Reference/BetterEnd/.../world/features/terrain/SpireFeature.java} (120 lines) and
 * {@code FloatingSpireFeature.java} (98), placed by {@code placed_feature/spire.json}
 * (rarity_filter 4, in_square, biome) and {@code floating_spire.json} (rarity_filter 8). Both
 * configs are empty objects, so every number below is hard-coded in the feature class.
 *
 * <h2>The shape</h2>
 * BCLib's SDF library stacks spheres with {@code SDFSmoothUnion}, and the trick that makes a spire
 * is that {@code addSegment} (SpireFeature.java:102-107) puts each NEW sphere at the origin and
 * lifts everything already built ABOVE it. So the last sphere drawn is the BOTTOM one, and radii
 * that grow as {@code i * 1.3 + 2.5} therefore widen downward: a cone, half-buried in the ground.
 * <p>
 * The floating spire runs that loop again in reverse (FloatingSpireFeature.java:46-53), which turns
 * the cone into a spindle widest at its middle. Dropping that second loop is the single easiest
 * thing to lose in this port -- the result still looks like a spire, just the wrong one -- so
 * {@code SpireShapeTest} measures where the widest slice sits.
 * <p>
 * A displacement node then ADDS two {@code abs()}'d simplex octaves to the signed distance
 * (SpireFeature.java:60-70). Because they are absolute values the noise can only ever eat INTO the
 * shape, never grow it, which is what makes both early-outs in {@link #inside} exact rather than
 * approximate and what bounds the write extent analytically.
 *
 * <h2>Why a planner and not a term in {@link IslandField}</h2>
 * A spire is three to twelve thousand blocks written once per ~120 chunks. Folding it into the
 * density field would make every column query in the world pay for a candidate scan. This is the
 * {@link CaveCarver} trade in the other direction and for the same reason: the mod runs it as a
 * feature, after the fill.
 * <p>
 * Never reads a block. The mod's replace predicate (SpireFeature.java:109-118) admits end stones,
 * leaves and anything replaceable-or-plant -- in blossoming_spires that is every block that exists
 * there, air included -- so "fill the shape" is not an approximation of it, it is the same set.
 *
 * <h2>Cost</h2>
 * Measured over 19,600 chunks at seed 12345: 1.27% of chunks grow a spire, averaging ~4,000 blocks,
 * for <b>18.5 us/chunk amortised</b> -- about 3.5% of the carve-and-coat budget. The flood fill is
 * what keeps it there; sweeping the bounding box instead costs roughly six times as much, and the
 * two exact early-outs in {@link #inside} skip the simplex for every cell that is clearly outside or
 * clearly buried.
