/**
 * BetterEnd's trees, in a {@link BlockPopulator}.
 * <p>
 * They cannot be CraftEngine {@code placed_feature}s, and the reason is NOT the decoration gate:
 * CE runs its own features outside {@code shouldGenerateDecorations()} altogether
 * (InjectedCustomChunkGenerator.java:177-216), and that flag is true now in any case. The reason is
 * that every BetterEnd tree's configured feature is a custom Java type with an empty config, and CE
 * parses pack features with the vanilla {@code ConfiguredFeature} codec and THROWS on failure
 * (BukkitWorldManager.java:802-804) - a {@code {"type":"betterend:lacugrove"}} is a hard pack-load
 * error, not a skipped entry. CE's feature placement is also seeded per chunk from
 * {@code RandomSupport.generateUniqueSeed()}, i.e. non-deterministic. BlockPopulators, by contrast,
 * run unconditionally inside the patched decoration method (ChunkGenerator.java.patch:113-124).
 * <p>
 * Follows BetterEndPopulator exactly: no block is ever read back (CraftEngine's
 * {@code deceive-bukkit-material} makes reads lie, and a neighbour's populator may not have run),
 * every write is clipped with {@code isInRegion}, and every terrain decision comes from
 * {@link IslandField}. Holds no mutable state beyond two caches; Paper runs this concurrently for
 * many chunks and Folia per region.
 * <p>
 * <b>All nine species resolve.</b> An earlier revision of this javadoc claimed the five wood species
 * were dormant for want of {@code <family>_bark} / {@code _log}, on the strength of
 * B1-wood-families.yml instantiating only four families. That was wrong: B1 adds the four NEW
 * families (mossy_glowshroom, end_lotus, umbrella_tree, jellyshroom), while the five original wood
 * families come from the separate {@code config_factory#wood_sets} in wood_sets.yml, whose instances
 * list is pythadendron / lacugrove / dragon_tree / tenanea / helix_tree / lucernia. All fifteen ids
 * (bark, log, leaves for each of the five) were verified present against a full factory expansion of
 * every blocks/*.yml. Concluding "absent" from one file is the recurring mistake on this pack --
 * expand every factory and template before believing an id is missing.
 * The mushrooms need no leaves and every id they do need resolves, so they generate the moment
 * this populator is registered -- all three of their host biomes ship (BiomeSurface.java:34-35,
 * :41-42, :70-71). The "host biomes are unshipped" note that used to stand here cited
 * BiomeSurface.java:198-200 and was stale: all 27 ship (BiomeSurface.java:216-218).
