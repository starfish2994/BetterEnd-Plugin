/**
 * Works out which blocks a chunk's cave faces should become: the mod's
 * {@code CaveSurfaceCoatFeature}, as a pure function of the terrain.
 * <p>
 * Without it the caves {@link CaveCarver} and {@link TunnelCarver} dig are bare end stone in every
 * biome -- no jadestone banding in the jade caves, no moss in the lush ones.
 *
 * <h2>Why this port is simpler than the mod's, and more correct</h2>
 * The mod's feature spends most of its length on one problem it cannot otherwise solve: nothing in a
 * block state distinguishes a carved cavern from the sky above an island or the void beside it,
 * because the End's aquifer hands carved positions back as plain {@code AIR}, not {@code CAVE_AIR}.
 * So it classifies air by shape -- walking each column bottom-up and counting a run as cave only
 * when rock closes it at both ends inside a deliberately over-wide band -- and accepts, in its own
 * words, that a cavern breaching an island's underside stops being coated at the breach.
 * <p>
 * This port never reads a block. {@link IslandField} says where rock is and the carve plans say what
 * was removed from it, so the three states are exact:
 * <pre>
 *   density &lt;= 0            -&gt; OPEN  (sky or void; never painted, and never painted against)
 *   density &gt;  0 &amp;&amp; carved   -&gt; CAVE  (a face to coat)
 *   density &gt;  0 &amp;&amp; !carved  -&gt; ROCK  (paintable, if the biome fills it with plain end stone)
 * </pre>
 * The swept band can then be the carve band rather than the mod's wider classification band, and a
 * cavern that breaches an island is coated correctly right up to the breach.
 * <p>
 * Pure and Bukkit-free, so the index arithmetic and the shell transform are unit-tested without a
 * server. Deterministic in {@code (placement, field, plans, chunk)} alone.
