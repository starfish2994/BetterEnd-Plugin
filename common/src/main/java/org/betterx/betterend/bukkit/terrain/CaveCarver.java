/**
 * The mod's round cave carver, ported to a per-chunk pass.
 * <p>
 * Source: {@code Reference/BetterEnd/.../world/carvers/EndCaveCarver.java} and its configured form
 * {@code worldgen/configured_carver/round_cave.json} -- probability 0.4, radius uniform 10..30,
 * centre y uniform 8..56, vertical_squash 1.6.
 * <p>
 * <b>Why a per-chunk pass and not a term in {@link IslandField}.</b> Folding the caves into the
 * density field would keep {@code isSolid} / {@code topY} / {@code isEndStone} automatically honest,
 * but a column query would then have to test every start chunk within reach -- 7x7 = 49 candidates,
 * of which ~40% pass the probability roll -- and evaluate a 3D simplex per candidate per y inside the
 * band. That is several times the whole chunk's current noise budget. Carving after the fill costs
 * work proportional to the carved volume instead, which is what the mod does
 * ({@code WorldCarver} runs once per chunk, after {@code fillFromNoise}).
 * <p>
 * The one thing that buys is also its one cost: {@link IslandField#isEndStone} still reports solid
 * inside a carved cavern, so {@code BetterEndPopulator}'s ore blobs can place a few blocks into cave
 * air. Surface things are unaffected -- {@link #SURFACE_ROOF} guarantees a cavern never comes within
 * five blocks of the column top, so {@code topY}, the surface cap and every plant and tree are
 * exactly as they were.
 * <p>
 * Caves only exist under the six cave biomes, because that is where the mod attaches this carver
 * (see {@link BiomePlacement#allowsCarvers}). An earlier revision of this class carved under all 27
 * biomes, which was a whole class of caves the mod does not generate.
 * <p>
 * Deterministic in the world seed alone: every cave is derived from
 * {@link IslandField#mixSeed(int, int, int)} of its own start chunk, so the same chunk carves
 * identically no matter which thread or which neighbour asks first, and no cross-chunk state exists.
