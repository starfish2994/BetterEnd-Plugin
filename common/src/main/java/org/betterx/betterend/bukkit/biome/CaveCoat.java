/**
 * What a cave biome paints onto a carved cave face: the wall shell, the floor and the ceiling.
 * <p>
 * The mod keeps these on its {@code EndCaveBiome} subclasses rather than in the biome json, and its
 * own {@code CaveSurfaceCoatFeature} javadoc explains why: {@code JadeCaveBiome.getWall} picks from
 * three jadestones with two noise fields <i>per position</i>, which no datapack
 * {@code BlockStateProvider} can express. Flattening it to one stone or a dumb random mix is exactly
 * how the jade caves lose their banding.
 * <p>
 * Only three of the six cave biomes paint anything at all. The three {@code empty_*} caves override
 * nothing, so their walls, floors and ceilings stay the end stone the carver exposed -- that is the
 * mod's intent, not a gap in this port.
 * <table>
 *   <caption>The whole table</caption>

 * Pure Java, returning CraftEngine ids as strings exactly as {@link BiomeSurface} does, so the
