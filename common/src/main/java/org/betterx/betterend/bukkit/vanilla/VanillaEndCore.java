/**
 * The disc around the world origin that stays vanilla so the vanilla End furniture -- the obsidian
 * pillars, their end crystals, the exit portal and the dragon fight that reads them -- keeps
 * working.
 *
 * <p><b>This plugin never places that furniture.</b> Vanilla does, and it has to, because
 * {@code EnderDragonFight.getSpikeCrystals()} finds the dragon's healing crystals by scanning the
 * bounding boxes of {@code EndSpikeFeature.getSpikesForLevel(level)} -- a seed-derived spike list
 * with no Bukkit or Paper accessor (Paper-26.1.2
 * {@code paper-server/patches/sources/net/minecraft/world/level/dimension/end/EnderDragonFight.java.patch:63-66}).
 * Pillars placed by a plugin land at coordinates that list does not contain, so the crystals fall
 * outside every {@code spike.getTopBoundingBox()}, the dragon never heals, and SUMMONING_PILLARS
 * beams at empty air. That failure looks fixed, which makes it worse than the current visible
 * breakage. The whole restoration is therefore two settings owned by other files, and this class
 * only holds the constant they must agree on:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code DustWastelandsGenerator.shouldGenerateDecorations()} must return {@code true} --
 *       {@code EndSpikeFeature} is a placed feature of the {@code minecraft:the_end} biome and runs
 *       in the vanilla decoration pass, which that flag gates
 *       ({@code CustomChunkGenerator.java:306}).</li>
 *   <li>The BiomeProvider must return {@code Biome.THE_END} for every block in
 *       {@link #inCoreQuart}, because a chunk only carries the feature list of the biomes actually
 *       painted in it.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Both are independently sufficient to break the pillars, so both are required.
 *
 * <p><b>This is now the ONLY vanilla region.</b> It replaces the second one,
 * {@code BiomePlacement.inCentralRing} (a 1024-block disc), which used to hand the surface path
 * plain end stone as far out as r=1024 and flipped biome id, surface, dust cap, speckle, filler,
 * fog and the tree gate along a chunk-quantized rim that cut straight across real islands. That rim
 * was the visible seam players reported. BetterEnd biomes and surfaces now paint everything outside
 * this disc, and this one remaining boundary is hard because it lies in void -- a hard edge across
 * empty space has no ground to show it, which is the mod's own design
 * ({@code EndLandBiomeDecider.java:47-55} is an equals() on a tag, no falloff).
 *
 * <p>Pure functions of block coordinates, no state, so it is deterministic and safe to call from
 * the concurrent worldgen threads.

     * <p>A circle, matching the mod's own inner-void cull, which is a circle in block space
     * ({@code IslandLayer.java:93-94}, ported at {@code IslandField.java:449}). That makes the
     * margin a single number comparable directly against the spike footprint and the island reach.
     *
     * <p>Deliberately NOT conditioned on terrain. Reusing an island-density probe makes each pillar
     * depend on {@code BiomePlacement.isLand}, whose column scan steps 4 blocks and can skip a thin
     * slab; one quart column reading void under one spike centre silently drops that pillar, and a
     * nine-pillar ring looks deliberate while the dragon heals from nine crystals. One {@code long}
     * multiply removes the whole class of failure.
     *
     * <p>384 is bounded on both sides by measurement, with wide margins either way:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Floor ~96: the boundary must clear the pinned central island so it sits over void. Its
     *       radius is {@code 0.5 (unit SDF) * 1.3 (fixed scale, IslandField:461) * 100 (medium
     *       layer scale)} ~= 65, measured 78.9-85.6 across five seeds once radial noise is on.</li>
     *   <li>Ceiling ~874: land resumes where islands whose centres cleared
     *       {@code IslandField.INNER_VOID_RADIUS_SQUARED} (1024 blocks) spill inward -- big layer
     *       scale 200 x island scale <= 1.5 -> <= 150 blocks of reach. Zero land samples were found
     *       anywhere in r in (100, 900) on every seed probed.</li>
     *   <li>Spike footprint 47.3 = {@code sqrt((42+5)^2 + 5^2)}. 384 / 47.3 ~= 8.1x. The ring
     *       radius is no longer inferred ({@link EndSpikes}), so this margin is now free headroom
     *       rather than insurance, and it is what lets the disc stay unchanged at 384.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The spike chunks (-3..2 on both axes) are WHOLLY inside the disc -- every one of their
     * 9216 blocks passes {@link #inCoreQuart} -- so they resolve to {@code the_end} at every
     * position within them. Vanilla's biome-check position for a placed feature (feature origin vs
     * spike centre vs chunk origin) is not readable in this checkout, and whole-chunk coverage over
     * the spike chunks makes it not matter. Note the disc is a circle, so chunks out near the rim
     * are NOT wholly inside it (chunk 23's corner sits at r=542); only the spike chunks need to be.
     *
     * <p>ponytail: this is the calibration knob, and it has two knobs above it. An owner who raises
     * {@code generator.layers.medium.scale} past ~590 grows the spawn island past this boundary and
     * puts ground on the seam; the fix is to raise this number, not to add a blend. And the "no
     * ground on the boundary" property holds only while {@code generator.generate-central-island}
     * is true (its default): that one flag owns BOTH the pinned island and the inner-void cull
     * ({@code IslandField:449,461}), so turning it off fills the whole origin with ordinary islands
     * and this boundary -- like the 1024-block one it replaced, and like any boundary at any radius
     * -- then cuts across real land. Measured with it off: ~1600 solid columns straddle r=384 on
     * each of three seeds. Nothing can fix that but not drawing a boundary, which the pillars
     * forbid.
