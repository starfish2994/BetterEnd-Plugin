/**
 * The ten vanilla obsidian spikes, derived from the world seed instead of read back out of the
 * world.
 *
 * <p>This is a line-for-line port of {@code EndSpikeFeature.SpikeCacheLoader.load} and
 * {@code EndSpikeFeature.getSpikesForLevel}, read from a CFR decompile of the running
 * {@code paper-26.2.jar} ({@code EndSpikeFeature.java:60-63} and {@code :179-192}); it settles what
 * {@link VanillaEndCore}'s javadoc used to call NOT DETERMINABLE. Nothing places spikes -- vanilla
 * still does, for the reasons in {@link VanillaEndCore} -- this only says WHERE they are, so a
 * decoration pass can find them with zero block reads.
 *
 * <p>Every hop is plain {@link Random}. {@code SingleThreadedRandomSource} (:38-51) is the identical
 * 48-bit LCG -- its {@code next(bits)} uses {@code >>} where {@link Random} uses {@code >>>}, which
 * is inert because the seed is masked to 48 bits and is therefore never negative -- and
 * {@code BitRandomSource.nextInt(int)/nextLong()} (:21-41) are byte-identical to {@link Random}'s.
 * So no NMS type is needed and this class stays testable with no server.
 *
 * <p>Pure and stateless: safe to call from any worldgen thread, on Paper and on Folia.
